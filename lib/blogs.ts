        q: 'Is buying a family-owned business riskier than buying a corporate-run one?',
        a: 'Not inherently riskier, but the risks are different in kind. Financial informality and owner/employee dependency need more attention; outright fraud or complex corporate liabilities are often less of a factor than in larger, professionally-run targets.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How do I value a family business with informal financial records?',
        a: 'Start by reconciling all available records, bank statements, tax filings, and GST returns, against what the seller states verbally. A CA experienced in SME valuations can normalize the numbers, but expect the process to take longer and require more documentation requests than a business with clean, audited books.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Will employees stay after a family business is sold to an unrelated buyer?',
        a: 'It depends heavily on how the transition is handled. Direct conversations with key staff before closing, retention agreements for critical roles, and a visible transition period with the outgoing owner all improve the odds significantly compared to a sudden, unexplained ownership change.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Should I be concerned if a family business seller wants to stay on after the sale?',
        a: "Not necessarily. A defined transition period, where the seller supports the handover of relationships and knowledge, is often valuable. The concern is a seller who wants to stay indefinitely involved in decisions, which usually signals they haven't actually committed to the exit.",

        q: 'What EBITDA multiple do pharma businesses sell for in India?',
        a: 'Founder-owned businesses in the Rs. 50–500 Cr range typically sell at 6–8× EBITDA. PE-backed assets with institutional governance trade at 18–24×. The Torrent-JB Chemicals deal at 24.8× is the current ceiling for institutionally prepared assets in Indian mid-market pharma.',

        q: 'How long does it take to prepare a pharma business for sale in India?',
        a: 'Meaningful preparation typically requires 18–36 months. Priority items: professional management layer, clean P&L, documented customer relationships, resolved governance gaps, and funding any dormant capability. Businesses that begin 24 months before an intended sale will have significantly more options at exit.',
      },

        q: "What did KKR do to increase JB Chemicals' value before selling to Torrent?",
        a: 'Five moves over five years: appointed a professional CEO, ran a consistent bolt-on strategy across five targets, funded a dormant CDMO capability that grew to Rs. 446 Cr, improved EBITDA margins from 15–18% to 27–29%, and rebuilt governance to institutional diligence standards.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What is the difference between a motivated and a distressed seller in Indian pharma M&A?',
        a: 'A motivated seller approaches the market by choice, with time and options. A distressed seller approaches because an external pressure — a compliance deadline, a succession crisis — has removed optionality. Motivated sellers price at the top of the range; distressed sellers price at the bottom.',
      },

        q: 'Do I need an investment bank to sell a pharma business in India?',
        a: "For businesses in the Rs. 50–300 Cr range, a boutique M&A advisory firm with Indian mid-market pharma experience will typically be more effective than a large investment bank. The advisor's most important work happens in the 18–24 months before any sale process — not during it.",
